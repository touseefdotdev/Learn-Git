    <h2>What is Git?</h2>
    <p>Git is free and open-source version control system. A version control system, or VCS, tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together. As developers make changes to the project, any earlier version of the project can be recovered at any time.</p>
    <p>Developers can review project history to find out:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Which changes were made?</li>
        <li>Who made the changes?</li>
        <li>When were the changes made?</li>
        <li>Why were changes needed?</li>
    </ul>
